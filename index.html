        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <h3> I am a 2nd Year at The University of Cincinnati with a major in IT with a specialization in Game Development and Simulation. <br>
            I decided to pursue this major because I have always had a passion for video games and technology. <br>
        I am also pursuing a minor in History. History has always interested me and I love to learn about the past   </h3>
